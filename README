cryptoshot - making and saving encrypted screenshots

==== GENERAL
This application will make a screenshot of the desktop. If the desktop consists of multiple monitors
it should still work fine. However it has only been tested with a dual monitor setup.

cryptoshot uses public/private RSA keypairs to protect the AES 256bit session key.
Additionally a SHA512-HMAC is calculated over the encrypted data using a 256bit key.
All keys are random and you are encouraged to change the "personalization strings" in the code which are 
used as input for the random number generation. The PRNG does not depend on them, but it's recommended
to change them.

==== USAGE
To use cryptoshot you need to prepare the cryptoshot binary with a public key:

C:\test>cryptoshot_pki_init.py binaries\cryptoshot.exe
Generating RSA keypair of size: 2048
Generation done
Saving private key to: private.key
Adding public key to binaries\cryptoshot.exe

Then you run cryptoshot which will produce a screen.enc file. You can decrypt this as follow:

C:\test>cryptoshot_decrypt.py binaries\screen.enc
Importing private rsa key private.key
Parsing encrypted screenshot binaries\screen.enc
Decrypting aes key and iv
Decrypting hmac key
Verifying hmac
Decrypting screenshot
Saving decrypted screenshot

Make sure you don't loose the private RSA key or you will not be able to decrypt screenshosts.

==== FILE FORMATS
The modified executable file containing the public key looks like this:

|--------------------------|
| executable               |
|--------------------------|
| public RSA key           |
|--------------------------|
| length of public RSA key |
|--------------------------|

The encrypted file format looks like this:

|---------------------------------|
| length encrypted session key    |
|---------------------------------|
| RSA-OAEP encrypted AES KEY + IV |
|---------------------------------|
| RSA-OAEP encrypted HMAC key     |
|---------------------------------|
| HMAC of the encrypted data      |
|---------------------------------|
| AES encrypted screenshot        |
|---------------------------------|

==== FILE OVERVIEW
The following files are part of cryptoshot, the one with a * are the minimum required to use:

binaries/cryptoshot.exe* 
    uses winmain, thus it does not popup on screen when run
binaries/cryptoshot_cmd.exe 
    traditional main, mainly intended for debugging purposes
cryptoshot_pki_init.py*
    generates rsa public/private keypair and appends them to cryptoshot
cryptoshot_decrypt.py*
    verifies hmac and decrypts the screenshot
