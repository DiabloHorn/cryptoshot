cryptoshot - making and saving encrypted screenshots

This application will make a screenshot of the desktop. If the desktop consists of multiple monitors
it should still work fine. However it has only been tested with a dual monitor setup.

cryptoshot uses public/private RSA keypairs to protect the AES 256bit session key.
Additionally a SHA512-HMAC is calculated over the encrypted data using a 256bit key.
All keys are random and you are encouraged to change the "personalization strings" in the code which are 
used as input for the random number generation. The PRNG does not depend on them, but it's recommended
to change them.

The modified executable file containing the public key looks like this:

|--------------------------|
| executable               |
|--------------------------|
| public RSA key           |
|--------------------------|
| length of public RSA key |
|--------------------------|

The encrypted file format looks like this:

|---------------------------------|
| length encrypted session key    |
|---------------------------------|
| RSA-OAEP encrypted AES KEY + IV |
|---------------------------------|
| RSA-OAEP encrypted HMAC key     |
|---------------------------------|
| HMAC of the encrypted data      |
|---------------------------------|
| AES encrypted screenshot        |
|---------------------------------|

The following files are part of cryptoshot, the one with a * are the minimum required to use:

bin/cryptoshot.exe* 
    uses winmain, thus it does not popup on screen when run
bin/cryptoshot_cmd.exe 
    traditional main, mainly intended for debugging purposes
cryptoshot_pki_init.py*
    generates rsa public/private keypair and appends them to cryptoshot
cryptoshot_decrypt.py*
    verifies hmac and decrypts the screenshot
    
enjoy,
